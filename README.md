This is a Python script that automates git committing and pushing

## How to use

Put the script in the repo folder and run:

```
./git_done.py "your commit message"
```

**Tip**: you might want to add the file name (`"git_done.py"`) to your
`.gitignore`.

## Caveats

This scripts works with a couple of assumptions:

- There is already a git repo.
- The remote (i.e. GitHub) repo is already set up.
